# ‚ö° CPU Optimization for VPS

**NEW:** This project now includes CPU optimization features to prevent VPS crashes during heavy processing.

For optimal performance on your VPS, configure the following environment variables:

```bash
# For small VPS (1-2 cores, 2-4GB RAM)
export MAX_CPU_THREADS=2
export CPU_USAGE_LIMIT=0.5
export MAX_CONCURRENT_TTS=1
export MAX_CONCURRENT_VIDEO=1
export MAX_CONCURRENT_HEAVY_TASKS=2

# For medium VPS (2-4 cores, 4-8GB RAM) - RECOMMENDED
export MAX_CPU_THREADS=4
export CPU_USAGE_LIMIT=0.7
export MAX_CONCURRENT_TTS=2
export MAX_CONCURRENT_VIDEO=1
export MAX_CONCURRENT_HEAVY_TASKS=3
```

üìñ **See [OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md](OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md) for complete optimization details.**

# Starting the project

## Using Docker

```
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -it gyoridavid/ai-agents-no-code-tools:latest
```

If you have an NVidia GPU and have the [Cuda Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed, you can run the server with GPU support

```
docker run --rm --gpus=all -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all -p 8000:8000 -it gyoridavid/ai-agents-no-code-tools:latest-cuda
```

## With python

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the application
   ```bash
   fastapi dev server.py --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

## Monitoring Resources

Use the included monitoring script to track CPU/memory usage and server load:

```bash
# Install monitoring dependencies
pip install psutil requests

# Run the monitor
python monitor.py
```

This will show real-time information about:
- üñ•Ô∏è Server status (online/offline)
- ‚ö° Server load (busy/available)
- üìä CPU and memory usage
- ‚öôÔ∏è Current optimization settings
